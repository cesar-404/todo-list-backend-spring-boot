Create a complete RESTful API, demonstrating the ability to develop in a realistic environment. The API will be a task management system.

- [❌] Task Listing: Users should be able to list all registered tasks.
- [❌] Task Update: Users should be able to update the details and status of an existing task.
- [❌] Task Deletion: Users should be able to delete a task.
